# Review Plan 

## How are we going to review documents and software and check that reviews have taken place?
  
We are going to review documents and software by arranging group meet-ups and arranging Pair-programming. i will explain in further detail how we will manipulate ideas such as meetings and pair programming to ensure that every stage work remains consistent and specifically
 structured and informative thereby removing issues later on the stages.
  
We will be able to make use
  of changes and review changes using plans, templates and dates/deadlines which helps us review documents and adjust document plans based off of information we have. We will review documents software
  by looking at how they will meet our criteria and the criteria that has not been met. By using a plan, which will be given to each member of the group during a meeting, we are able to see what is not up to date and what needs improvement in the software/document produced.
   
  We will be looking and reviewing documents to see how criteria have changed since the last review and also against our plan. An example may be is a software failed 3 tests and the plan was to have 2 test fail and  the next meet-up showed us that 4 failed, we will use this as a measure of progress which indicates no progress has been made at all. This was all by reviewing work based of our current plans.
  
  We can easily accommodate pair programming by working on the same project by arranging group meet-ups. This is linked to review meetings
  as we are able to have a date set available for users to meet up and pair program. We will review progress by the end of every set date and we will analyse work that has been completed and compare work based of off plans created in our previously arranged meeting. 
  
  Within our group we will create a set of tasks to be completed in one meeting and have the work available for the next meeting. This will be our main methods of ensuring actual progress against planned progress. Review meetings could take place to adjust plans and processes as at the end of a review we may have noticed plans may need to change as ew ideas come in and solutions are found. Reviewing will entail us looking at what changes have been made. This includes issues such as us causing a failure to a document/software. This is an idea of how meeting reviews will be based on previous versions ensuring we reach the quality of code and work. We have organised a plan suggesting where we will analyse work and adjust plans based of off work completed.
