# Version Control
The tools we are using for this project are: GitLab, IntelliJ, Papyrus.

## Processes
* GitLab:
    * Provides online storage and branching in case reviewing or fixing is needed before merging with the master branch.
    This allows our group to ensure that work that would be submitted to the master branch will include all the necessary 
    information we need. An example of the detail we go through the process will be an example of our last meet-up we 
    completed our planning document using IntelliJ and we then pushed the document using GitLab, we would then arrange 
    another meet-up where we would assess what has been pushed to GitLab and track any changes to documents. We would use
    version control to have a look at progress and at times we would refer to older versions of documents such as our code 
    or documents as the older versions may have functionality that the newer versions of our work may not have due to us progressng
    with our work. 
    
    * Provides revert functions in case of issues with branch we are able to roll back to the most recent commit. This 
    entails us to go back to older forms of the document where we are able to continue from there instead of trying to fix
    an error we encountered. Our group uses the intelliJ/GitLab function that allows us to create new branches where we 
    are able to work independently and then push any progress made and merge to the master branch, this reduces conflict
    in data and allows every one in the group to have their own copy of the document at any given time. The reason we did
    not decide to push straight to the master branch is that this can cause conflict for the project master to deal with 
    as there would be many different conflicts and files that the project master to approve.
    The use of GitLab and IntelliJ provides convenient online editor for files so we can edit our documents online.

* IntelliJ:
    * IntelliJ and GitLab compatible with a wide variety of types of documents that can be edited to ensure everyone can edit all the files used in this project.
    This gives us freedom and trust in how we interact with documents we upload to Gitlab as we know this software suports multiple
    file types.
    * IntelliJ is compatible with GitLab which ensures compatibility across platforms and ease of issue management. We are 
    able to easily retrieve old documents due to compatibility and easily make amendments to work.

* Papyrus:
    * Papyrus being compatible with GitLab which ensures compatibility across platforms and ease of issue management. This
    was a useful feature as part of our last assignment was to create a uml diagram which we could easily link
    to GitLab without any issues, this provided us with a strong foundation to improve and edit our work.
