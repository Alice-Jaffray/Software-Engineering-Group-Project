# Project Management Plan

Our plan for managing the project includes iteration planning, meetings, communication and a gantt chart      

## Details of Plan

* Iteration Planning
    * By planning iteratively we are ensuring that we always have a plan and idea of what the next stage of the project 
    looks like.
* Meetings
    * We are planning to have meetings bi-Weekly, one at the beginning of the week to set up what work needs to be done 
      for the week (Tuesday 13:00) and one at the end of the week to check the progress of our work and get feedback from 
      the rest of the group (Friday 16:00).
    * These meetings will be documented within .md files, this include the minutes of the meeting, the work that needs 
      to be done, the work that has been completed since the last week and any amendments to the current plan or feedback.
    * The template for the meeting file is stored on gitLab. 
* Communications
    * Our group will communicate between meetings via a group chat on WhatsApp. 
* Gantt Chart
    * We will create a gantt chart on Excel Spreadsheet to track our progress on tasks and the whole project to ensure 
      we stick to our pre-determined timeline.
