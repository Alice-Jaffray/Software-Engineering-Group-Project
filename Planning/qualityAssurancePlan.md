# QA (Quality Assurance) 



In order to ensure a high consistency and quality throughout our project documents, it is important to abide to…
## 1.	Establish who takes lead.

To elaborate on this, it is important as a group to know who will be the main communicator of the project, usually someone who has a deeper understanding of the project and is able to assign roles to the right group members. Someone in charge will usually establish decisions such as…

* As a group we will define the expectations of how project documentation should be.
* As a group we will decide whom to be responsible for different documentation, which the leader will over see.
* As a group we will discuss or recommend how (how many words/pages, what to include etc…)
* The leader (Conor) may provide the team with templates in-order to maintain consistency.

##2.	Make sure documentation is always being monitored.

This is so all group members are always up to date with each other’s documentation so you can be informed that you are on the right tracks, which allows high quality and consistency amongst peers. Below is how we should achieve this…

* Allow access of documentation to peers, using Git or Google docs so others can suggest changes.
* Keep in contact with peers at all time if unsure, in-order to prevent mistakes and lose in quality.

##3.	Focus on one thing at a time

During this group project we can expect for high work load, so it is important to keep on top it, so we can maintain better focus on one document at a time rather than trying to do multiple at the same time. In order to achieve this, we should follow the bullet points below.

* Make sure group members keep to strict time management, so nothings rushed, as that will affect quality.
* Plan, so when it comes to working on the documentation we will already have an idea of what to do.
