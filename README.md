# YUCONZ EMPLOYMENT RECORD SYSTEM
Program designed to allow for the digitization of HR documents 
so that they do not have to be stored on paper.

System will, in its first iteration, be able to create and 
store documents that contain:
* An employee's personal details.
* Records of employee reviews.
